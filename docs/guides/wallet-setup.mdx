# Wallet Setup

This guide covers creating wallets and generating addresses in BTQ Core.

## Prerequisites

- BTQ Core daemon running (`btqd`)
- `btq-cli` available in your PATH

## Create a Wallet

Create a new wallet to store your keys and track balances:

```bash
./btq-cli -testnet createwallet "my_wallet"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "name": "my_wallet",
  "warnings": []
}
```

<Note>
Wallet files are stored in `~/.btq/testnet3/wallets/` (testnet) or `~/.btq/wallets/` (mainnet).
</Note>

## Generate a Dilithium Address

Generate a quantum-resistant Dilithium address (recommended):

```bash
./btq-cli -testnet -rpcwallet="my_wallet" getnewdilithiumaddress
```

This returns a Dilithium address starting with `n` (testnet) or `1` (mainnet).

### Alternative Address Types

| Type | Command | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| Dilithium (recommended) | `getnewdilithiumaddress` | Quantum-resistant transactions |
| Legacy | `getnewaddress "" "legacy"` | Compatibility with older systems |
| Bech32 | `getnewaddress "" "bech32"` | Standard SegWit addresses |

## Load an Existing Wallet

If your wallet isn't loaded, load it first:

```bash
./btq-cli -testnet loadwallet "my_wallet"
```

## Check Your Balance

```bash
./btq-cli -testnet -rpcwallet="my_wallet" getbalance
```

## List Your Addresses

View all addresses in your wallet:

```bash
./btq-cli -testnet -rpcwallet="my_wallet" listreceivedbyaddress 0 true
```

## Backup Your Wallet

<Warning>
Loss of your wallet file means loss of funds. Always maintain secure backups.
</Warning>

Copy the wallet file to a secure location:

```bash
cp ~/.btq/testnet3/wallets/my_wallet/wallet.dat /path/to/backup/
```

Or use the backup RPC:

```bash
./btq-cli -testnet -rpcwallet="my_wallet" backupwallet "/path/to/backup/wallet.dat"
```

## Encrypt Your Wallet

Protect your wallet with a passphrase:

```bash
./btq-cli -testnet -rpcwallet="my_wallet" encryptwallet "your-strong-passphrase"
```

<Warning>
If you forget your passphrase, your funds are permanently inaccessible. Store it securely.
</Warning>

## Unlock for Transactions

After encryption, unlock the wallet to sign transactions:

```bash
./btq-cli -testnet -rpcwallet="my_wallet" walletpassphrase "your-passphrase" 60
```

The `60` is the unlock duration in seconds.
