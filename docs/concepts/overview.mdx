# What is BTQ?

**BTQ (Bitcoin Quantum)** is a post-quantum resistant cryptocurrency that combines Bitcoin's proven architecture with quantum-safe cryptography.

## Why Quantum Resistance?

Quantum computers pose a threat to traditional cryptographic algorithms. Bitcoin uses ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for transaction signatures. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could potentially:

- **Break ECDSA** - Derive private keys from public keys using Shor's algorithm
- **Compromise funds** - Steal coins from addresses with exposed public keys
- **Forge signatures** - Create fraudulent transactions

While large-scale quantum computers don't exist yet, the threat is real enough that NIST has standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.

## BTQ's Solution

BTQ addresses this by implementing **CRYSTALS-Dilithium**, a NIST-standardized post-quantum digital signature scheme (FIPS 204).

## Key Differences from Bitcoin

| Feature | Bitcoin | BTQ |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Signature Scheme | ECDSA | ECDSA + Dilithium |
| Signature Size | ~72 bytes | ~2,420 bytes (Dilithium) |
| Public Key Size | 33 bytes | ~1,312 bytes (Dilithium) |
| Block Size | 4 MB (weight) | 64 MB limit, 32 MB soft cap |
| Quantum Resistant | No | Yes (with Dilithium addresses) |

## How It Works

### Dilithium Signatures

When you create a Dilithium address, BTQ generates a key pair using the Dilithium algorithm. Transactions from this address are signed with Dilithium signatures instead of ECDSA.

### Larger Transactions

Dilithium signatures are significantly larger than ECDSA (~2.4 KB vs ~72 bytes). BTQ accommodates this with:

- Increased block size limits
- Adjusted weight calculations
- Updated mempool policies

### Script Integration

BTQ extends Bitcoin's scripting with new opcodes:

- `OP_CHECKSIGDILITHIUM` - Verify Dilithium signatures
- `OP_CHECKMULTISIGDILITHIUM` - Multi-signature support

## Network Parameters

| Parameter | Mainnet | Testnet |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| P2P Port | 9333 | 19333 |
| RPC Port | 8334 | 18334 |
| Address Prefix | `1` | `n` or `m` |

## Development Roadmap

BTQ follows a phased integration approach:

1. **Phase 1** ✅ - Core cryptography wrappers
2. **Phase 2** ✅ - Address and script extensions
3. **Phase 3** ✅ - Wallet and key management
4. **Phase 4** ✅ - Transaction signing
5. **Phase 5** ✅ - Networking and mempool
6. **Phase 6** ✅ - RPC and user interface
7. **Phase 7** - Security hardening and mainnet
