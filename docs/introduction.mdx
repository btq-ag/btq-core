## Dilithium Integration

BTQ integrates the Dilithium digital signature scheme, a NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithm. Key capabilities include:

- **Key Generation** - Create quantum-resistant key pairs
- **Address Generation** - Generate Dilithium-based addresses (Bech32 format)
- **Transaction Signing** - Sign transactions with post-quantum security
- **Message Signing** - Sign and verify arbitrary messages
